# StackUp Source of Truth Document

## Project Overview
**StackUp** is a **Trello-like task management application** built using the **MERN stack**. It provides users with the ability to create, manage, and organize boards, lists, and cards in a **drag-and-drop** interface.

### **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, React DnD
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Authentication:** JWT, bcrypt
- **Hosting:** Netlify (Frontend), Heroku (Backend)
- **State Management:** React Context API

---

## **Core Features**
### **User Authentication**
- Sign up, login, and logout functionality.
- JWT-based authentication with secure password hashing.
- Authenticated API routes for protected access.

### **Board Management**
- Create, update, and delete boards.
- Boards store lists that contain cards.
- Each board is associated with an authenticated user.

### **List Management**
- Create, update, and delete lists within a board.
- Lists hold multiple cards.
- Lists can be reordered within a board.

### **Card Management**
- Create, update, and delete cards inside a list.
- Move cards between lists using drag-and-drop.
- Assign labels and due dates to cards.

### **Activity Logging**
- Track actions such as card movements, edits, and deletions.
- Display an activity feed for users to review board history.
